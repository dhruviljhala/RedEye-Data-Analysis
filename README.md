RedEye is a one-of-a-kind off-campus shuttle service run by the Northeastern University Police Department (NUPD) that helps Northeastern University students staying off-campus, get home safely at night. Students who live within two miles of the centre of campus can use the RedEye shuttle services by downloading the Redeye app and reserving a ride through it.

NUPD started offering this service in 2017, and between Fall 2021 and Spring 2021, they received over 90,000 requests, which is the highest number ever in such a short period of time. However, due to rising demand, there has been a significant supply deficit for the past two years. Most students deal with long wait times, ride cancellations, and a shortage of available seats on a regular basis. Since graduate students who live off-campus, and students who stay in college until late rely on this service, we chose to focus our efforts on finding a solution to this problem, or at the very least easing the current situation, because the problem we are seeking to address is important and would have a significant impact on the Northeastern University student community. As a result, through this project, we will aim to bridge the demand-supply gap by first identifying operational bottlenecks, then reducing student wait times, and ultimately providing recommendations to boost the chances of students receiving a confirmed seat on the RedEye.

NUPD provided us with a large dataset of all requests made on the RedEye app over the course of roughly three years, from 2019 to 2022. There are 314,344 rows/observations and 31 columns/variables in the dataset.
